    ## Instruction ##
    This is an evaluation task.
    You will be given a question, gold answer(s), and predicted answer.
    Your task is to evaluate if the predicted answer matches against the gold answer(s).
option:
    binary: |
        Give your binary judge 0 or 1:
        * 0 means the predicted answer is wrong (unmatch)
        * 1 means the predicted answer is correct (match)
        When multiple gold answers are available (provided as a list), the predicted answer is correct if it matches with at least one of the gold answers.

        Provide your feedback as follows:
        ## Feedback ##
        [Rationale] (your rationale for the judge, as a text)
        [Judge] (your judge, as a number either 0 or 1)
    ternary: |
        Give your ternary judge 0, 1, or 2:
        * 0 means the predicted answer is wrong (unmatch)
        * 1 means the predicted answer is partially correct/wrong (partial match)
        * 2 means the predicted answer is correct (match)
        When multiple gold answers are available (provided as a list), the predicted answer is correct/partially correct if it matches/partially matches with at least one of the gold answers.

        The question is being asked by a user who is cooking {activity_name}.
        Well-trained annotators constructed gold answer(s), while the predicted answer was by a machine, which answered based on the corresponding recipe and the frames of the cooking recording.
